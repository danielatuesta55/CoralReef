        <p> Deforestation, one of humans kind worst attributes. By demolishing our rainforest, we are essentially creating our paths towards extinction. Christina Nunez (2019) mentions that between 1990 and 2016, the world lost 502,000 square miles (1.3 million square kilometers) of the forest. If you think about that number is equivalent to an area larger than South Africa. </p>

            <p>The link between deforestation and global warming has been proven over time by multiple studies, scientists, and activists; with that said, deforestation is still happening. For this particular project, we researched the world's biggest rainforest, The Amazon rainforest. Multiples countries share this forest, but the country that has the most land is Brazil.</p>

            <p>We looked into Brazil to see the history of deforestation and their ongoing attempts to stop it. WE gather data from the year 2004 till the year 2019; critical years in the war against deforestation. It was not until 2003 that the government started to regulate deforestation in the Amazon rainforest firmly. With new implementations came new challenges and the effect this had at the beginning was astonishing. As you can see on our graphs, deforestation went down, but it wasn't until 2008 and, more specifically, 2015 when illegal deforestation started to take a toll on the Amazon Rain forest. With the government possibly lowering their guard on this crucial aspect, multiple agencies saw this as a chance to take a piece of the forest for profit.</p>
