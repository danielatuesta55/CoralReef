With drastic predictions that humans will demolish the seas floor by the year 2054, we decided to focus our attention on creating a visualization tool for users to see the changes of coral reefs in recent years worldwide. The idea behind this is to showcase the drastic impact that we are having on our ocean floors and at the same time create consciousness to the user of said problem.

Understanding that humans won’t call earth home if the ocean dies is crucial in this never-ending battle with global warming, recycling, and fishing! We hope that with this tool, the user can understand visually what’s happening to our reefs around the world. Now get ready to dive into the seas!
